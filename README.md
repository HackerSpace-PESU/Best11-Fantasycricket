## How do you verify your model??

We use six matches from the World Cup 2019 for our verification as of now,namely

* England vs Australia League Stage
* England vs AUstralia SemiFinal
* India vs New Zealand SemiFinal
* India vs Australia
* India vs Bangladesh QuarterFinal
* England vs India

During the ICC World Cup the winners of the fantasy cricket league was shown and their respective scores were also showed.
</br>We use those scores to match our models score.

We predict the team and calculate the dream 11 score of each player for that match and match it with the winning score and calculate loss.   
</br>

To check how our model worked in our test data run : 

```bash
python3 cricket/'Final project'/check.py 

```
